I am a Professor of Statistics at the University of Nottingham in the UK. My main area of study has been the development of statistical methodology in highly-structured data analysis, including shapes, images and functional data. I obtained my PhD from the University of Leeds in 1989 and I have taught and carried out research at the University of Nottingham, University of South Carolina, University of Leeds and University of Chicago. I was Head of School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Nottingham from 2014-2018. I have published about 150 articles, and my joint book on Statistical Shape Analysis has about 5000 citations (Google Scholar). I have given many invited presentations worldwide, and was co-organiser of a year-long programme on the Analysis of Object Data at SAMSI, North Carolina. I have been PI/Co-I of more than £15 million in grants from EPSRC, BBSRC, NERC, Leverhulme Trust, Royal Society, Innovate UK and NSF. I am an elected Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and was awarded a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award (2012-2017).
