- 👋 Hi, I’m Ian Dryden

- I am a Professor of Statistics at the University of Nottingham in the UK. 

- My main area of research is the development of statistical methodology in highly-structured data analysis, including shapes, images and functional data. 

- I obtained my PhD from the University of Leeds in 1989 and I have taught and carried out research at the University of Nottingham, University of South Carolina, University of Leeds and University of Chicago. I was Head of School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Nottingham from 2014-2018. 

- I have published about 150 articles, and my joint book on Statistical Shape Analysis has about 5000 citations (Google Scholar). 

- My main open source coding project has been the *shapes* library in R. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shapes/index.html
